            <h3>Community Service and Advocacy</h3>
            <p>
               Our faith calls us to serve others with love and compassion. As believers, 
               we are called not just to speak about kindness, but to live it out through action.
               This page highlights initiatives that reflect God’s love through community work and advocacy.
