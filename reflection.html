            <h3>My Reflection</h3>
            <p> 
                In today’s digital age, it is easy to get lost in the noise of social media and technology. 
                But as a follower of Christ, I believe that faith should guide every action — even online. 
                Putting “Una ang Ginoo” reminds me that every post, comment, and creation should reflect kindness, honesty, and love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being a “Light of the World” means using technology responsibly — to uplift, inspire, and share hope with others. 
                Instead of spreading negativity, I choose to be a source of encouragement, reflecting God’s goodness through my digital presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to create a positive impact, one message at a time. 
                Whether it’s helping a friend, posting something meaningful, or supporting good causes, 
                I will continue to put God first in everything I do — both offline and online.
