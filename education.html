            <h3>Living with Integrity Online</h3>
            <p>
               As technology becomes part of our daily lives, our faith must guide how we act, speak, and share online. 
               Digital ethics means showing respect, honesty, and kindness even when no one is watching — because God always is.

                    <h4>1. Be Honest and Truthful</h4>
                    <p>
                       Avoid plagiarism, false information, or deception online. 
                       Integrity means being truthful in what we post, share, or create.

                    <h4>2. Show Kindness and Respect</h4>
                    <p>
                       Treat others with love and compassion, even during disagreements. 
                       Our words should reflect God’s love and not hatred or mockery.

                    <p>
                       Be careful about sharing personal information and photos — your own or others’. 
                       Respect boundaries and promote safety.

                    <p>
                       Share content that inspires hope, spreads truth, and uplifts spirits. 
                       Be a light in the digital world by using your voice for good.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                   Practicing digital ethics is an act of faith — a way to honor God in our online behavior. 
                   By putting “Una ang Ginoo” first, we ensure that our actions reflect His character and bring light to the digital space.
